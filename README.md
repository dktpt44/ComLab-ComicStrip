## Project Name: Got your back

## Project Description:
_what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create._
This is a comic book project designed to be presented on a webpage. The comic tells a story of two soldiers in battle. Since the assingment required the comic to be shorter, we wanted to create a story that quickly grabs the attention of readers with exciting twists. 
The comic itself was hand-drawn in a drained, simplistic style. This applies some of Scott McCloud's theories of simplicity, allowing the audience to be drawn more towards the plot and characters than the actual details of the frames. 
The website follows two main paths to tell the story. The _webpage_ version allows the readers to scroll through the comic while individual sprites in frames flow through at their own pace. This was designed to create a more livly and vivid atmosphere. The _flip book_ path follows a more traditional way of comic book story telling, allowing the readers to flip through the story page by page. 
Overall, we wanted to create a short story that briefly captures the attention of our readers, powered by unique but simplistic website design.

## Reflection/Evaluation:
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
